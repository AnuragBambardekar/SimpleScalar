simulated, either "alpha" for Alpha OSF, or "pisa-big" for PISA big
endian.


GCC:

  to run:               sim-safe cc1.<target> -O 1stmt.i
  to test output:       diff 1stmt.s 1stmt.s.ref

ANAGRAM:

  to run:               sim-safe anagram.<target> words < anagram.in > OUT
  to test output:       diff OUT anagram.out

COMPRESS95:

  to run:               sim-safe compress95.<target> < compress95.in > OUT
  to test output:       diff OUT compress95.out

GO:

  to run:               sim-safe go.<target> 50 9 2stone9.in > OUT
  to test output:       diff OUT go.out
