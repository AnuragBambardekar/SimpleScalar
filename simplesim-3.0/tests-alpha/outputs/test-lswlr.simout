sim-eio: This simulator implements simulator support for generating
external event traces (EIO traces) and checkpoint files.  External
event traces capture one execution of a program, and allow it to be
packaged into a single file for later re-execution.  EIO trace executions
are 100% reproducible between subsequent executions (on the same platform.
This simulator also provides functionality to generate checkpoints at
arbitrary points within an external event trace (EIO) execution.  The
checkpoint file (along with the EIO trace) can be used to start any
SimpleScalar simulator in the middle of a program execution.

# -config                     # load configuration from a file
# -dumpconfig                 # dump configuration to a file
# -h                    false # print help message    
# -v                    false # verbose operation     
# -d                    false # enable debug message  
# -i                    false # start in Dlite debugger
-seed                       1 # random number generator seed (0 for timer seed)
# -q                    false # initialize and terminate immediately
# -chkpt               <null> # restore EIO trace execution from <fname>
# -redir:sim     outputs/test-lswlr.simout # redirect simulator output to file (non-interactive only)
# -redir:prog    outputs/test-lswlr.progout # redirect simulated program output to file
-nice                       0 # simulator scheduling priority
-max:inst                   0 # maximum number of inst's to execute
-fastfwd                    0 # number of insts skipped before tracing starts
-trace           eio/test-lswlr.eio # EIO trace file output file name
# -dump                <null> # specify checkpoint file and trigger: <fname> <range>

  Checkpoint range triggers are formatted as follows:

    {{@|#}<start>}:{{@|#|+}<end>}

  Both ends of the range are optional, if neither are specified, the range
  triggers immediately.  Ranges that start with a `@' designate an address
  range to trigger on, those that start with an `#' designate a cycle count
  trigger.  All other ranges represent an instruction count range.  The
  second argument, if specified with a `+', indicates a value relative
  to the first argument, e.g., 1000:+100 == 1000:1100.

    Examples:   -ptrace FOO.trc #0:#1000
                -ptrace BAR.trc @2000:
                -ptrace BLAH.trc :1500
                -ptrace UXXE.trc :
